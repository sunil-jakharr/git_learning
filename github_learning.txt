* cloneing of existing repo
 
canbe done in two ways: 1. SSH 2. HTTPS
SSH: unique key which you have to enter only once
HTTPS: every time you have to enter the user id and password while cloning

* to clone repo
-- git clone enter the ssh or https link 

* to view all the branches
-- git branch -r    ////dispalys all the branchs on the repository

*  to chec the status of the branches 
$ git status
to checl all the untracked files in the local repos cloned in the local, shows up in read


-- makes changes in this stage to the files
*  to add all the chnaged files to the branch but not yet commited
Git add . 
here . adds all the files to which chnages have been made
*  commiting the chnages to main branch
git commit -m "inital commit check of txt file"

* the commit does commit the the local repo. tp push it to  the main remote repo
  we make use of the git push commnand

 git Push  
 used to push the chnages to the remote repo

git branch -list   --to list all the branches in the local

git branch branch_name-- to create new branch

git checkout branch_name-- to swtich between the different branches

git checkout -b branch_name -- to create a new branch and switch to that branch


** to push the changes of the new branch to new branch in the remote repo
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name -- when the branch is not present in the
						remote repo use this command
